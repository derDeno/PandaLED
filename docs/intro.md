## What is PandaLED?
PandaLED is a control board designed for P1 and X1 Bambulab printers. It allows you to connect WLED, classic (analog) LED strips, or any device operating on 12V or 24V with a maximum current of 3A.

The board controls connected devices based on events. A complete list of available events is provided on the Mappings page. Using the WebUI, you can define mappings, which provide a simple yet powerful way to associate events with outputs.

**Example:**
You can map a "finished print" event to the WLED output to turn the LEDs green and have them turn off automatically after 10 minutes.


## What makes this project special?
The standout feature of PandaLED is its mapping tool, which provides an intuitive way to connect events with devices. This eliminates the need for firmware modifications or coding skills.

Additionally, the exposed GPIO pins enable further customization, allowing you to connect additional devices or design custom expansion boards to enhance functionality.


## Where can I get this board?
Currently, the board is in its final development phase and is not yet available for purchase. However, a preorder option is planned for the near future.
