# Debugging
To facilitate troubleshooting, you can enable "Debug Logging" in the [Device Settings](setup-device/device). 
This option records system events and activities into a log file.

## Accessing Logs

1. Navigate to the "Log" page in the WebUI.
2. View the log entries directly on the page.
3. Use the available options to either:
    - Delete the log file.
    - Download the log file for further analysis.

Enabling debug logging is a helpful way to identify issues and understand what is happening within the system.
