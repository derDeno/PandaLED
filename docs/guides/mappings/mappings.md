# Mappings
This guide will explain what mappings are, their purpose, and how to create them.

## What do Mappings Do?
Mappings simplify automating tasks by linking events (like "print finished") with specific actions (e.g., changing LED colors or turning on a device). This eliminates the need for manual intervention or coding knowledge.

## How to Create Mappings

2. **Add a New Mapping**:
    - Select an event from the dropdown list (e.g., "Print Finished").
    - Select an output from the dropdown list (e.g., "WLED").
    - Assign an action to the selected event (e.g., change LED color, PWM signal).
    
3. **Define Parameters**: Input any necessary details, such as colors, delays, blink.
4. **Save Your Changes**: Ensure to save your mapping for it to take effect.
