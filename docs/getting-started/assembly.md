# Assembly
This guide will help you to assemble your PandaLED board and power it up.

All found [here](/getting-started/sourcing-parts#pandaled-case).

The mounting holes on the PCB are made for M3 screws, in case you want to mount the PCB somewhere.

You can power your PandaLED board using one of the following methods:
1. **USB-C**
2. **DC Barrel Plug**

If you are looking for parts, check the [sourcing parts](/getting-started/sourcing-parts#power-supplys) page.

Also, when flashing using USB-C, disconnect the DC cable if connected.
