Below is an overview of the available connections and their specifications. WLED​ The WLED output port is a 3-pin connector designed exclusively for use with 5V LED strips, such as the WS2812b. Port Type: 3-pinVoltage: 5V using USB-C or using the DC connector with 12V or 24V.Supported LEDs: WS2812b (5V)Pin Layout: Printed on the bottom side of the PCB Generic / Analog​ The Analog output port is a 6-pin connector capable of delivering either 12V or 24V, depending on the connected power source. This port is inactive if the board is powered solely via USB-C. Port Type: 6-pinVoltage: 12V or 24V only. Powering using USB-C will not work.Usage: Designed for RGB CCT LED strips but can be repurposed for other devices due to PWM control or on/off switching capabilitiesPin Layout: Printed on the bottom side of the PCB GPIO​ The PCB includes a range of GPIO pins, enabling you to expand the board's functionality with additional features or extension boards. The GPIO pin layout is as follows (viewed from the top): 3.3V\tEN\tTX\tRX\tIO 0\tIO 33\tGround\t5V Ground\tVP\tVN\tIO 34\tIO 35\tIO 32\tGround\tVCC (12V/24V) This table is also printed on the bottom of the PCB. info Ensure proper voltage compatibility when connecting devices.Refer to the PCB's printed labels for accurate connections.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Mapping Backup & Upload","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/PandaLED/guides/setup-device/mappings","content":"Mapping Backup &amp; Upload This page allows you to: Backup your mappings for safekeeping or sharing.Upload an existing mapping file to restore or replace current mappings. warning When uploading a new mapping file, this will overwrite all your existing mappings.
