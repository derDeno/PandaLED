# Learn how to make a pull request

A few great resources on how to contribute to open source for the first time.

- [Fix a typo in the docs with a Pull Request](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github/) - Create simple PR's entirely in GitHub
- [Make your first Pull Request here](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/README.md) - A repo that guides you through making a pull request on itself

Have a great resources to share here? Create a pull request! :smile:
